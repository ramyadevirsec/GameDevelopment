AIM :
	To write a C program to perform line clipping using Cohen Sutherland Algorithm.
EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
●	Hardware: Personal Computer (PC)
●	Software: C Compiler

ALGORITHM :
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Get the bottom-left coordinate of view port from the user. 
Step 3: Get the top-right coordinate of view port from the user.
Step 4: Get the coordinates of 1st end point of line from the user.
Step 5: Get the coordinates of 2nd endpoint of line from the user.
Step 6: Print the region code of the first and second point.
Step 7: If the points lie inside the view port, print ”The line is totally visible”.
Step 8: If the starting point lies outside the view port, print “The line is invisible” 
Step 9: If the starting point lies inside the view port and the ending point lies outside the        view port, print “The line is partially visible” 
Step 10: Clip the line present outside the view port.
Step 11: Draw the clipped line present inside the view port.
Step 12: Stop
