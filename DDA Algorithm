Aim :
To  implement the DDA algorithm to draw a line using a c coding

Algorithms :

Step 1 − Get the input of two end points (X0,Y0) and (X1,Y1)
Step 2 − Calculate the difference between two end points dx and  dy 
Step 3 − If dx > dy, then you need more steps in x coordinate; otherwise in y coordinate.
Step 4 − Calculate the increment in x coordinate and y coordinate
Step 5 − Plot the pixel by successfully incrementing x and y coordinates accordingly and complete the drawing of the line
