AIM :
          To implement the projections in three dimensional image using a C coding.


ALGORITHM :

   Step 1 : start.

   Step 2 : Draw any image in the three dimensional plane.

   Step 3 : Get the choice of axis as input from the user.

   Step 4 : Perform the projection about the desired axis.

   Step 5 : Display the projected image.

   Step 6 : Stop.
